# Graphics
C++ Graphics 1 module for Computer Science.

This program does multiple things:
1. Takes an MD2 file and draws it in a wireframe.
2. Removes and backfacing vertices to make the image seem more 3D.
3. Transforms that wireframe into a single block colour image.
4. Uses lighting to bring out the depth of the model.
